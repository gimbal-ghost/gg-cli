## Installation
At this time, Windows, Linux and MacOS are supported.

### MacOS
Gimbal Ghost can be installed by downloading and running the `Gimbal Ghost.app` asset below. You can also copy `Gimbal Ghost.app` to the Application folder.

### Windows
Gimbal Ghost can be installed by downloading and running the `GimbalGhost.exe` asset below.

### Linux
Download `GimbalGhost.AppImage` and mark it as executable before running. This is a portable executable and will not be installed. For better system integration, consider setting up [AppImageLauncher](https://github.com/TheAssassin/AppImageLauncher) if your distribution does not already provide it.

### Future Updates
Gimbal Ghost is automatically updated in the background. When opening the app it checks for updates and downloads them in the background. Updates are installed when you close the app. NOTE: The app will not open until the background installation is completed.

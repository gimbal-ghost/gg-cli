## Installation
At this time, only Windows is supported and can be installed by downloading and running the `GimbalGhost.exe` asset below. 

### Future Updates
Gimbal Ghost is automatically updated in the background. When opening the app it checks for updates and downloads them in the background. Updates are installed when you close the app. NOTE: The app will not open until the background installation is completed.
